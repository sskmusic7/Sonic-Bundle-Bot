Hey Everyone! 

I wanted to introduce myself. My name is Omar, I'm the owner of the store [IamRetro.com](http://IamRetro.com)

As some of you may know, we are a bit new to providing the Jakks Pacific line of figures in our store. I've seen our store name being mentioned here on Reddit and I thought it would be a great opportunity for me to post here and reach out to the Sonic community. We have had an account with Jakks for about a year coming up and the selection of items continues to grow. 

So I thought posting here would be a good way to have an open dialogue and connect with collectors. If you have any questions for me, or about how our business works, or any products you think we should carry, please let me know.

│ Really awesome finally having good communication from a real jakks pacific seller. 
│ 
│ 
│ Do you guys plan on stocking every NEW Jakks Sonic and SEGA wave going forward (2.5, 4, 5 and 6 inch)? 
│ 
│ 
│ It's so hard to keep track of which new waves go to which stores both physically and online (mostly due to how Jakks ships each wave), but if the majority of them were all in one place that would change everything!

  ┌─ u/iamretro1 | 16 points | 2025-04-25 15:44:58
  │ That's so refreshing to hear! 
  │ 
  │ The answer is YES!! We are planning on continuing to offer every single wave we can each in 2.5" + 5" and 6" basically any variation that they start to release for the Sonic releases. We do have incoming stock of Shadow collectors edition and Sonic Prime Wave 5 incoming. It's just taken a lot of capital investment to bring in the right amount of stock to keep our inventory active. As well as keeping up with a lot of the other lines of figures Jakks produces like Simpsons and Mario. But we should be getting to all cylinders firing shortly. 
  │ 
  │ I agree it is tough to keep track of everything which is why we see the opportunity to try and provide some reassurance in the collector space on finding these items consistently in one place.

    │ Can't wait to see more and thanks again for reaching out to the community!
    │ 
    │ 
    │ One more note I'll leave you with (because you're gonna hear it from everyone at some point):
    │ 
    │ 
    │ - if possible, try and find a way to increase stock of other characters in each Sonic wave. Sonic himself gets a lot per shipment while the other characters like Knuckles, Eggman and Neo Metal Sonic only get ONE figure per shipment (all scales/sizes). This is the main issue consumers have with most jakks products (especially with Sonic and SEGA).
    │ - I know that might be difficult to work out, but I just thought I would point it out in detail now since it's going to be a big request you will hear non stop from the community over time.

      │ Haha! Yes, you are absolutely spot on with this one. Unfortunately when we purchase from Jakks Pacific we get them in case packs and the case packs are already determined in advance which characters we will get more of than others. 
      │ 
      │ We will do our best but that's also why we are seeing that the more rare figures tend to sell out faster than the commons. There have been multiple suggestions on how to keep the more rare or limited figures in stock but yes we are already dealing with that on the Simpsons line of figures and also with Sonic. Thank you for your feedback and definitely feel free to reach out in this thread anytime you'd like to communicate with me on things you may spot that could be a huge help to the community. I know we won't be able to please everyone in all of this but we are putting our best foot forward to be a consistent and reasonable source for the collectors alike in the Jakks Pacific world. 
      │ 
      │ Appreciate you!

        │ Figured as much. Personally, I was more just curious on what is and isn't possible because every figure that isn't Sonic is considered rare. Lol.
        │ 
        │ 
        │ (now everyone knows 😅)
        │ 
        │ 
        │ Well, I would say just continue to promote your new inventory and keep those available for as long as humanly possible. That would give everyone enough time and a chance to make iamretro a more recognized distributor of Jakks pacific products. You'd be surprised how many new fans we get in this community literally every day.

      ┌─ u/iamretro1 | 7 points | 2025-04-25 15:47:10
      │ Yes! Agreed, and we have weekly meetings with Jakks to stay in the loop as a lot of the time things are moving so fast. Their products are in such high demand that when inventory does become available it sometimes evaporates with a quickness but hopefully we can be another avenue for collectors to check in with us if you have no luck finding these in the wild (Target, Walmart, etc.)

  │ Get Free Shipping within the USA when you spend $29

  │ Free Shipping to Worldwide when you spend $299
  │ 
  │ This is the total it has to match after any discounts or coupon codes applied on the above pricing thresholds. But if you just need a single figure definitely rates do apply and we always do our best to try and provide multiple ways to offer good value to customers with shipping rates.

  ┌─ u/iamretro1 | 3 points | 2025-04-25 16:28:34
  │ Thank you and Noted!

  │ Do collectors like to purchase the new waves as a complete set or do you guys tend to shop for the characters individually?
  └─
    ┌─ u/Finn493 | 2 points | 2025-04-25 16:42:50
    │ We tend to chase after the new and unique figures from each wave no matter what the size is (but new fans might still want the older figures they previously missed out on).
    │ 
    │ 
    │ Bundling each NEW figure from each wave and excluding the re-releases could be a cool idea (and just sell the re-release by itself).
    │ 
    │ 
    │ But overall, Single releases of each figure will always be the most popular idea.
    └─
      ┌─ u/iamretro1 | 2 points | 2025-04-25 17:46:48
      │ Good to know! I think we'll offer bundled sets of the new waves and also individual figures so collectors can grab what they need. Thanks for the feedback!

      │ Just a heads up we have Wave 22 of the 2.5" Sonic figures coming in within the next week or so. We were initially thinking of putting together a set to sell but after the feedback you provided I think you're right and we will be offering the figures individually.

└─
  ┌─ u/iamretro1 | 3 points | 2025-04-25 18:03:54
  │ That's awesome to hear! I'm so happy we could provide an opportunity for the collectors to get the figure at a reasonable price. It's been really tough to keep up with the demand of this figure. As we get confirmed orders from Jakks they are instantly selling out which is why we had a back order placed on the item in our shop. But we only backorder items we have 100% confirmation we are receiving inventory and dedicated to our store. 
  │ 
  │ Really appreciate the message and will be updating everyone on new incoming items that should be landing in the shop.

Dealing in toys since 2013.

  │ 
  │ Also as everyone else said I would definitely like to see y'all restock more on other characters it's hard for a lot of us in smaller towns trying to search for figures just seeing only sonic himself 😭 Neo metal/jet/silver will definitely be your biggest request realistically unlike those people asking for super shadow

  │ Our website is filled with verified buyers who leave reviews for us. They also post pictures of their collections which you can find on our home page if you scroll down. Do a quick google search "iamretro" you'll see we have been around for a while. But we are fairly new to the Jakks Pacific space. If you're on the fence about doing business with us I understand, but you can also check us out on instagram where we have over 27k followers.

  ┌─ u/iamretro1 | 2 points | 2025-04-26 15:00:31
  │ Hey there, thanks for commenting. Yes we will be restocking but we also need confirmation that Jakks will be guaranteeing us units. This will go into a "backorder" which just means that the moment we get the confirmation from Jakks, we will make those incoming units available for purchase. All we will be waiting for is Jakks warehouse to process a shipment to IamRetro warehouse and once our crew checks in and receives the inventory, then orders can begin to get processed. This backorder is a temporary wait usually around 10-14 days. 
  │ 
  │ I'm just clarifying in case there is any confusion. We should be getting a confirmation on a restock shortly but until then we don't want to solicit anything we cannot guarantee. Make sure to sign up for the "Notify Me" request on the listing so you an email letting you know when they go back into a positive inventory.

Often times there is absolutely no way we can match big box stores pricing but it just depends on the overall availability and access we have to the product and also margin. We just don't have the same purchasing power as a Target or Walmart but we do try our best. Really appreciate your comment!

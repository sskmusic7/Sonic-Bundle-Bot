│ Got Charmy for $75 on (Optimus prime voice) EBay. Got the blue emerald by buying the sonic 2024 advent calendar. Now for super shadow. Gonna wait for wave 3 super movie shadow 5 inch. Bc of right coloring, better articulation and I don’t have to spend $200 on it

  ┌─ u/GammegageTM | 4 points | 2025-02-04 18:43:16
  │ I'm not paying anywhere near that price for Charmy. And I'm not going to buy the entire event calendar for that single emerald.
  └─
    ┌─ u/Acceptable-Feeling12 | 1 points | 2025-02-04 18:46:02
    │ True fair game. I bought charmy bc I sold something so used it for charmy. The advent calendar i got for the chaos emeralds and sold the sonic Christmas figures. Plus it was in sale so why not get the advent calendar, save money and get all of the  chaos emeralds
    └─
    ┌─ u/Reddyy08 | 1 points | 2025-02-04 19:47:57
    │ It’s honestly worth buying the calendar since it’s probably the cheapest way of getting the blue chaos emerald
    └─
      ┌─ u/GammegageTM | 1 points | 2025-02-04 20:09:07
      │ I know my luck, the second I obtain the advent calendar, there is going to be a new figure that I don't have announced that comes with the blue emerald as it's accessory.

  ┌─ u/ChaosOmega | 1 points | 2025-02-04 23:33:58
  │ nice :) , I got charmy for 92 bucks on ebay with 35 other 2.5 inch figures for free... so I guess  technically i got charmy more for 2.56  with each figure costing that much. not sure which one sounds funnier,

  │ Yeah, I figured that not everyone would be in this situation, but I thought about this one night and thought it would be a funny post.
  │ 
  │ And yes, I did end up getting Mephiles for $9.99 off Amazon when that was available, but that sold out incredibly quickly, and I've never actually seen him in stores.

│ I bought the Shadow recently and feel so-so on it. What does everyone think of this one? I thought Shadow felt kinda cheap and had loose joints

  │ Shadow sucks. Sonic sucks for different reasons though. He includes more extra parts and feels more worth it that way, but the limbs are too thick and it'll look out of place next to Shadow with the thinner, more accurate limbs.

    │ Ya the the limbs are what gave me pause, I wish they were the same but these seem sturdier. Does the plastic on his head feel less cheap, that really irked me with Shadow

│ I might cancel the order it says it’s on “back order” when are they getting more units? when it restocks in 2 years😂😂
└─
  ┌─ u/ToyNerdProd | 3 points | 2025-03-18 23:56:09
  │  Jakks wholesale still has them in stock on their site so Retro is probably just waiting to receive more from Jakks before sending new orders out.

│ I just ordered one but it also says the item is currently on backorder. Does that mean ima still be able to get one? orr🥲
└─
  ┌─ u/ToyNerdProd | 2 points | 2025-03-19 00:06:33
  │ Jakks wholesale site still lists them in stock so Retro just has to wait a couple days to receive new stock from Jakks before shipping I assume

  │ IAmRetro is a legit store, they also have an eBay front and insta, they arent too big but in terms of products and customer service they are usually average at best.
  │ 
  │ Its okay to be suspicious about posts like this, but to comment that op is a scam without doing some quick research is silly.
  └─
  ┌─ u/ToyNerdProd | 5 points | 2025-03-18 19:09:26
  │ I Am Retro is a well known, reputable site and this is simply a referral code where the buyer and code provider both get discounts.

    │ This like, screams obvious scam imo. Could just be me being cautious, but I’d never buy from some random site.
    └─
      ┌─ u/ToyNerdProd | 6 points | 2025-03-18 19:11:07
      │ Right, so just because YOU have never heard of this site, it's a scam? A quick google would answer that question for you. This is the site where most people buy their Jakks Simpsons figures since they sponsor one of the biggest Simpsons toy Youtube channels.

        │ First thing that pulled up was “IAmRetro legit?” 
        │ 
        │ The most common scams are clicking links, it’s not wild to assume such.

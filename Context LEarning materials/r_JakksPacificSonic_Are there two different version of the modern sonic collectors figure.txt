So I saw someone say there are two different versions of the figure. One which is just regular plastic  then the other is like a a rubbery matte plastic finish. Is the right? Lol

│ It’s not rubbery but yes there are 2 different finishes the figure can have, I think it’s more down to quality control or different factory’s than variants though.
│ 
│ I’ve had both but only kept the glossy one, the glossy one is like most other jakks figures, and the matte figure I had felt almost like it wasn’t completely sanded or something, and the lines on the head looked really bad like it had weird lighter color patches, just seems like the quality control wasn’t as good, and that’s kind of unfortunate because I actually really like the way it looked other than the deflects, the wisp had a pretty decent paint spot missing on the front as well so I didn’t end up keeping that one
│ 
│ Overall I’d get the glossy version if you can

  │ Oh awesome! Because the other day I just got one from someone on eBay and was confused because it wasn’t like the shiny plastic.

  │ Does tails or knuckles have this variant problem too?

    │ Not that I know of although I haven’t had multiples of tails or classic sonic, no idea about classic knuckles

│ Idk about Sonic, but the ones I've seen online look like plastic, and the Tails I have has that rubbery material, so maybe??

  │ Thank you! I'm surprised anyone knows about it, glad you do! I spent probably close to 3-400 hours playing SA1 when I was young (still do haha) trying to 100% it. It was awesome when I finally did! The hammer upgrade was one of the longer ones I spent working on since I sucked so badly at the mini game lol

│ Is this like a prototype or something? Why does he have regular silvers body but with the bent arm like the prototype on the box had? And why does he have a standard head painted and or modeled yellow? If this is a prototype can you make a post about him?
└─
  ┌─ u/IshikuNanami | 4 points | 2024-02-14 02:43:11
  │ He's just a Super Silver 2.5" custom I'm working on. He's a regular 2.5" Silver that you can find at Walmart, and I painted the head. Still have to paint the body haha

        │ I sorta own one, it’s a mighty that has the face of the prototype but I got it off Amazon so I assume it’s just a misprinted copy but it’s exactly like the prototypes face with the unpainted mouth and slightly higher up eyes. I still have it but it’s in terrible shape due to me getting it as a early teen

            │ Here ya go, if I bought another one I could restore it but yeah he’s not in even decent shape. (The difference is the mouth not being painted and the smaller eyes)

│ I have to ask:
│ Did you buy those Sonic posters at Burlington? I've seen so many of them there like the ones you have.

  ┌─ u/IshikuNanami | 3 points | 2024-02-14 03:17:38
  │ Oh thank you so much I appreciate that! As someone who puts thought into every placement, that means a lot 😭

  │ Yes! They were all from Burlington :) They're actually really well made too!

    │ As a fellow collector, I get how much thought and time goes into organizing things. Be proud, you did an awesome job!
    │ 
    │ Man, I always get the urge to buy one of those posters, but I wouldn't know where to put them in my room. I've seen so many cool ones, I'm shocked that they didn't sell from their original retailer store.

      │ They're so cool! Every time I go I always wanna buy more, but I don't have enough space anymore 🥲 Me too! Burlington has had a ton of good stuff recently, it's really surprising!

  ┌─ u/IshikuNanami | 2 points | 2024-02-14 09:13:13
  │ Thank you so much, I appreciate that! I used a few of his artworks from the Advance games and Sonic Adventure and tried to mimic it the best I could! I used a lighter blue paint for the whole body, a dark blue for the shadows, and a really light blue for the highlights. I repainted his eyes with white and redid one eye to face slightly sideways and the other one winking. Then I just used either slightly lighter or darker paints for the rest of the shadows :) I just used generic Walmart and Hobby Lobby acrylic paint haha

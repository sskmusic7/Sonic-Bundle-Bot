Lets consider this idea:

A SIMPLE front end webpage that displays all the product bundles as a bundle (without showing the sources of course)

Users can buy a bundle as is 

The buy now feature takes them to our eBay listing for said bundles

Shipping prices are listed

Each bundle has a scrollable image gallery on the main page that contains an image from the original listings for the products (but doesn't have any link to access each piece)

Each bundle lists what each bundle comes with

Its a simple webpage that doesn't take you off the page each listing is on the page and visible to the user

Title is "Sonic Collector Zone" or something
"Find the missing piece to complete your sonic collection"

There are live reddit ticker feeds at the bottom featuring recent reddit request.

Again the page is simple.

There are #tags on each bundle listing for each sonic character it contains and clicking on a character name can show listings that contain it and hide listings that don't.

The emphasis of each listing is what it contains.

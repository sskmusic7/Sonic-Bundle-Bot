      │ You love to see it, this has been my favorite series since I was a kid and while some of the games can be kinda meh they’re still so much fun to play

        │ I remember one year I dressed up as Sonic for Halloween even though I had played none of the games at the time lol. I was probably 10. I enjoyed Sonic X Shadow Generations a lot. I tried Mania too but it’s not really my cup of tea. I’ve played all the other older games too of course and love them. I’m working through Rush right now and it’s a blast. I’m gonna try Adventure next and I can’t wait. I heard it’s one of the best.

          │ The Rush games are SO good. Growing up Sonic Adventure 2 was always my favorite and to this day it’s my favorite game ever made. My second favorite is CD, which is definitely not for everyone but it’s so good. I’m glad you liked Sonic X Shadow, too! It was great, and a great direction for the series moving forward. Hopefully you continue to enjoy what you’re playing!! If you’re working on the DS entries you have to try Sonic Colors for DS after Rush Adventure. It’s basically the 3rd Rush game and it’s so much fun, I just replayed it recently!

            │ The music in Rush is literally one of the best game soundtracks I’ve ever heard. I thought CD was the weakest out of all the classic games but that’s just me. It was still a good game though and Metal Sonic is an awesome character. I’ll check out colors after the Adventure games!!

              │ I really enjoy exploring in CD and how the gameplay can effect the environments. In the basic classic sonic design philosophy it doesn’t totally work but exploring and looking for the generators is really fun. I am also a victim of being swooned by the amazing aesthetics and soundtrack. I just enjoy going back to the game and 100% it in an afternoon and moving on. It’s so much fun! Sonic Rush does have so much incredible music too. It’s been a *looong* time since I’ve played it, I’m currently working through my DS library as a matter of fact so I’ll try and get to it soon! When you play the Adventure games, enjoy them for what they are and try not to focus on their shortcomings like many others do. In my opinion, they’re the best Sonic has ever been in terms of gameplay up until Shadow Generations recently. So fun, and nails the classic Sonic mentality of replayability being key. There’s also some games such as Shadow the Hedgehog that I cannot in my right mind call good, but I had so much fun last year when I finally played through the entire game. This series is something special, I’m glad you’re playing these games!

                │ The aesthetics and music is why I love Mario so much so I’m sure the more I play Sonic the more hooked I’ll get lol. I couldn’t imagine 100% the Sonic games I’ve played myself lol. I’m not gonna lie some of them were really difficult. But that’s part of the fun. From what I’ve seen, Adventure seems to really handle the characters well and has a lot of different character interactions which is something I think Mario lacks. I’ve heard mixed things about Shadow the Hedgehog lol. I’ll get to it when I get to it 🤷‍♂️

                  │ I only like to 100% the classic games. The modern games have way too much stuff that’s too challenging for me to 100%. I don’t really find many sonic games hard if I’m honest, but some of those challenges required to beat it are a serious pain. There are some games like Heroes and 06 that are hard because of infuriating design and not because of well crafted challenge, though. Sonic is pretty inconsistent but one thing across the series that hits hard is the music, and some games just have amazing aesthetics. The characters really are at their best in the Adventure games, they’re handled so well. As a fellow fan of both Mario and Sonic, Sonic definitely offers MUCH more in terms of character interaction and depth. And I’m curious what you’ll think of Shadow one day. It’s a mixed bag for sure!

│ This is a really good start, I love the 2.5 inch figures, they sadly don't have as big of a character size as the 4 inch line but they're really cool

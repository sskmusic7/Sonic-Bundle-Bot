│ Hot damn this is sick. Haven’t seen a sonic this good since the 3 in jazwares. Do we know the size?

  │ Well the last “Ultimate Collector’s Edition” figure (Classic Sonic) was 6”. So I’m making a pretty confident guess this will also be 6”

  │ Collector Edition Action Figure! This new figure measures 6inches tall and includes interchangeable faces, eyes, hands and a display base with lenticular scene! Ages 14 and up

  │ I’ve waited 15 years for something like this. Seems to only be up on Entertainment Earth at the moment so I may just snag it from there, I’m not missing my shot with this.

│ I want to be impressed but Sonics are usually too top heavy to get any dynamic posing in.
│ 
│ My favorite and best Sonic is my Nendoroid. A nice blend of eras and he won't fall over.

  │ I didn’t even think of that! I was so hyped to see a more complete Sonic. 
  │ 
  │ They are very top heavy and I don’t know why they don’t hollow the head out or something. Hopefully this one figured it out because I would love a solid sonic in my collection and not one who can’t stand. 
  │ 
  │ Also, I would love it if somebody made Sonic Adventure 1&amp;2 style figure with the Soap sneakers. Hopefully in the future

    │ I believe the head is hollow (classic Sonic’s was at least)

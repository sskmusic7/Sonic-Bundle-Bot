----------------------------------------
I'm fuming. I was there on the day of release for the Sonic × DC figures and just got a email saying they canceled my order. WHY!? I'm getting refunded but I'm so unbelievably upset. The Amy figure isn't even on the site anymore. It's just gone! I fear I'll never get her now...

│ i wouldnt worry over the multipack those are always mass produced and like after 2 months they're always up online

  │ So, should I even bother ordering again? I can't get the Amy anymore as she just doesn't exist on the site, apparently. But if the multi pack won't be an issue, I'd rather get it in person than order online.

    │ if you can get amy i’d recommend it online just in case 
    │ if you can wait a little while then don’t order the multipack

│ I think it’s mostly just because it’s not available in retail right now. It’s available on the website, but only for preorder since it comes out October.

  │ Oh no, I'm talking about the pre-order. The pre-order got canceled. That's why I'm angry.

    │ I can’t guarantee anything but in the past the 5 inch line figures have seem to have been produced a lot. Sonic prime figures were everywhere and the same thing happened with the Sonic 3 figures after the first few hype weeks died down. I’m hoping they’ll be in stores cause I’m not doing any pre-orders right now. Plus I think they’ll also be available to order online on the release day.

      │ I'll trust you then. I just fear they won't be around when they release. I'd be crushed to miss these amazing figures.

│ I had all of my DC Sonic Pops (besides Tails) and the Darkseid pack canceled as well. Luckily they were in stock for me to preorder again. Hopefully it'll stick this time.

│ Did you have sufficient funds in your account? Because they periodically do random holds sometimes even multiple holds on your account and if you don’t have the money in there they cancel the order. It happened to a lot of people who pre ordered the switch 2. I just know a lot of people think they don’t actually need the money til release date and will spend it with the thought process that by time it ships they’ll have the money. 🤷‍♂️

  │ I had WELL enough money for them. Just the 2 of these cost 70 dollars. My account has a couple of K. I was fine. They had 0 reason to cancel the order. 😭

│ They did that shit to you too? They told me it was some bullshit about "PayPal authorization", but when I spoke to the PayPal representative, they told me that it was *Target* who cancelled the goddamn order. Seriously, I just wanted to get these for my kids without having to pay fucking triple the price to some goddamn mouth breather who collects his own piss in bottles.

      │ Yep. Had to reorder it, which was a pain because it didn't appear when you search for it. Had to go through my history to find the link again.

        │ Were you actually able to reorder everything though? Because I could only reorder the four pack.

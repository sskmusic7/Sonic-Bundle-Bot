│ Was River's the more expensive one for you as well? Out of my collection her's was more than even the 14's. Curious how 15th's will be like. Also thinking about getting that chrome platted 12th Doctor's Sonic since it has the same colors as 14ths.

  ┌─ u/Leelinus1975 | 1 points | 2024-07-20 17:19:21
  │ Aw yes!  That one and the Master’s laser were the most expensive by far. And I got shafted because it was the version that’s only blue and the neural link doesn’t light up. 
  │ 
  │ People are selling SDCC pre-orders for 15’s makeup compact 😋on eBay for $150, but I put a hurting on my bank account after buying this stuff + most of the Funk POP’s I was missing.

    ┌─ u/Goodly88 | 1 points | 2024-07-20 17:23:58
    │ I waited until around Xmas last year for 14ths, turned out it was a knockoff. However, it had every light and worked just fine, may need fresher bats but works the same. Since it was about the same was when it came out for SDCC, I can't complain. The 12th Doctor's chrome will be about the same. 
    │ 
    │ My build-a-sonic was for a steal on ebay, however the core was swollen, but I managed to clean/fix it and works just fine. Even River's needed a good cleaning before batteries. Considering most I brought were still NiB.

      ┌─ u/Leelinus1975 | 2 points | 2024-07-20 18:11:57
      │ You know, I’m still not sure if I have the knockoff. Mine doesn’t have a lot of the knockoff’s tells, but does have one or two. I don’t care though. I watched a comparison video and the guy was shocked because he said he truly believed the knockoff was better. 🤷🏻‍♂️
      │ 
      │ My River sonic had a ton of corrosion in the battery case, but a little vinegar wipe down did the trick. 
      │ 
      │ I’m really ticked about the build your own sonic kit. Why couldn’t they charge a bit more and include two more cores?  I’m not going to display sonics that don’t work, so it seems like such a waste.

│ I got 12's sonic today! 
│ 
│ For some reason Amazon decided to split my order into 2 deliveries and only 1 of them showed up today (not the first time a Prime delivery has been delayed, and I'm actually quite cheesed about it now, probably what I get for using Amazon I suppose) 
│ 
│ But I got my sonic and 12 figure so I'm somewhat happy 
│ 
│ But I really wanted to fix my headphones today 😕 
│ 
│ Fingers crossed it comes tomorrow, because the second delivery also has my TARDIS

  ┌─ u/Leelinus1975 | 2 points | 2024-07-21 02:42:59

      │ And I dont see why she couldn't have just remade it at some point. First version being an on the the fly job with the melted spoons made sense, but why keep it like that? Once she got the Tardis back she could have remade it in a much sleeker looking model. One that looks less like a turd.

    │ If I didn't already have mine on the wall in fishing rod holders,  I'd go to ebay to look for these.  $16 for a nice looking rack that holds 5 Sonics is a better price than anything I've found aside from the fishing rod thing.
    │ 
    │ 
    │   I got 4 wall mounted racks that each hold 6 Sonics for 12 bucks. Better price and they don't take up any shelf space,  but yours look much nicer.

My collector’s edition finally arrived yesterday and was able to unbox it today after work! 🙌🏻 

This edition is really nice! I ordered this specifically for the Shadow figurine and the artbook. I thought the figurine would be a bit small but it is the right size for me and is a bit heavy. I haven’t checked the artbook since I have yet to play the game (still finishing up Radiant Tale lol).

Hope you guys enjoy the game! (Tell me how is it lol)

    │ I have the Japanese ps5 version, which doesn't come with the journal, it seems like urs is in English tho which confuses me

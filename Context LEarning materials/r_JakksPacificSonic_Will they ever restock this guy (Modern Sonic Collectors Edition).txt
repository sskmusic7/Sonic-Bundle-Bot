I’ve been looking for him for a long time now but it’s almost like he’s kinda being scrubbed from the internet. All the other collectors editions are widely available on most retailers but this guy is just kinda… gone? The only thing I really see is a Mercari posting asking for 150 dollars. (sadly I would pay it, if the seller would respond to any of my messages). Am I missing something? Was he part of a limited run? I’m hoping he gets restocked in the future cause it would suck to never see this guy again.

│ I would recommend you hold out for a bit longer. Seeing the new Ultimate Shadow figure, they will likely release a V2 of the Sonic mould with the same updated articulation.

  │ Yeah, I was going to put that in my post as well but didn’t want to make it too long. The only problem I have with an updated version would be that the ultimate shadow has no swappable hands or faces, so if an updated version comes out at some point I hope they don’t completely remove them like they are with shadow. (I still plan on buying shadow as well tho lol)

    │ In Shadows case, the reason he comes with no swappable accessories is down to the massive wings, and more complex stand he comes with. It's not likely Sonic would be given such a large accessory like that, though his amount of accessories would probably suffer a bit or a downsize, given more of the budget going to the figure itself. (Unless they manage to pull something similar to the Movie 3 figures or the Superposers, and articulate the fingers.)

    │ I haven’t seen any swappable faces but I’ve seen he comes with a couple swappable hands 🤷‍♂️

│ The shadow figure has very different articulation and it’s much better than this figure this figure is more like the prime figures while shadows like the movie figures. So they’ll probably make a v2 with updated articulation and maybe an updated stand to make it fit with the same style as the shadow

  │ Yeah he has way more points of articulation but at the cost of having no swappable hands or faces which isn’t the worst thing but if that’s the direction they wanna move into with a V2 sonic it would be cool to see the old modern one come back

    │ I think the missing accessories is mainly because of the giant doom wings that are about as big as a few accessories

│ very cool at the times bur aged terribly and the pricing sucks, after seeing the movie line i am confident in saying that jakks can do better for a fraction of that price

│ Man I hope they re-release or update this figure. I just got a knuckles one only to find out that they did this one, a classic sonic and a tails!

  │ Every now and then I see a scalper selling it for 100-125 dollars. I bought from someone who had both sonic and tails bundled for like 140+ Mercari fees

    │ Nice. I've been looking at Mercari. Looks like there have been a few modern sonics but they're all sold right now. I'm going to keep checking though! Just wish I'd heard about them sooner lol

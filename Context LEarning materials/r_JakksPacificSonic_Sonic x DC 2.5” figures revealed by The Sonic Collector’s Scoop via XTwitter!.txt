│ I thought they had the potential to do DC figures with that Darkseid until I saw this.

│ Man, that Superman and Batman figure is rough.

  │ Having experience with mcfarlane figures. Hard agree. These look terrible in comparison. But I believe the prices will go down drastically as well.  From 35ish to 15-20 I assume.

┌─ u/Morgluxia | 2 points | 2025-07-25 05:52:56
│ Really hope the Batman and Superman figs scale well with Marvel Legends, insane that your best options for figures of them that do is to spend triple digits on a mafex because Todd Mcfarlane refuses to go smaller than 1/10 scale

│ We were *this* close to getting an well articulated 6” Superman and Batman but they had to make it 5” instead 😭

    ┌─ u/No-Butterscotch589 | -2 points | 2025-07-25 01:50:22
    │ If it's 5 inch Knuckles they'd probably keep the elbows bent too. Why can't we have bendable elbows on Knuckles?
    └─
      ┌─ u/HaydenBoss2300 | 3 points | 2025-07-25 01:53:50
      │ No.. okay with all 2.5 inch figures, they do not have bendable elbows. Except Metal Sonic. And knuckles does have an instance where he has bendable elbows which is in the prime figures. I have said figure. He has bendable elbows. And in the same image shadow also has no bendable elbows! 😭

        ┌─ u/No-Butterscotch589 | 0 points | 2025-07-25 03:46:25
        │ I just want Knuckles to have bendable elbows at a 5 inch scale. Not all that difficult for them to do I'd think

              │ Oh yeah definitely. I hope the whole cast gets the 5 inch upgrade. Bring everyone having better joints and remodeling for their figures (I desperately want a Metal Sonic that is just a bit better)

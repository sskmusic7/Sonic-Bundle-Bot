  │ I wish I waited, although, it was a while ago I purchased the original Jet lol.

    │ The giant pecky is random inclusion but a welcome one. I think it’s a fun figure. Definitely will look out for jet and the pecky.

      │ Aye! Pecky is the main one I want, Jet too, not really fussed about the 8574th Sonic and number 4285 Tails.

│ Glad Tails is re-releasing. He's the only one of the main cast (other than Amy) that I don't have
│ 
│ Also the first time Jet is releasing in the UK, which is awesome

│ Really wish that Sonic or tails were a variant of some kind, possibly with extreme gear or something like that. These rerelease figures are getting stale to me, but Jet is always cool.

  │ Sonic with his extreme gear would be cool. It would be refreshing to see a bunch of those on shelves.

  │ It’s funny because I believe giant Pecky appeared only at the end of a level…💀

│ Take that scalpers! So glad my sister is in the UK and can receive my Smyths orders. I've got a really good feeling we're going to get a Tangle wide release soon...

  │ I was about to say if you needed help, I would’ve helped since I’m in the UK myself, but I’m glad you’ve got your sister to help out! 🫡

    │ Really appreciate it anyway, thanks!
    │ 
    │ I'd offer the same but I don't think Australia will be getting exclusives anytime soon

│ Hurray more stuff we've already had and a fat animal barley anyone is going to want.... God I hate this line sm they just make the same thing over and over and over

  ┌─ u/PartyGodMan | 2 points | 2025-07-12 14:47:37
  │ Atp these new waves are just a glorified restock for the rarer figs like jet
  └─
  ┌─ u/CarLeeForever7 | 2 points | 2025-07-12 14:54:29
  │ What would you like that’s realistic?

    ┌─ u/PartyGodMan | 2 points | 2025-07-12 14:59:23
    │ I just want them to spice it up for once, i liked the sports ones but they dont do that anymore. Im so tired of these bare boned figures with just the base character and a useless item, it would be fine if it was the first few waves but why do we get the same Sonic every single time? 
    │ Use different emotions, fists, accessories that aren't useless and can be held (without rubbing the paint off cough cough cream and her icecream) 
    │ 
    │ 
    │ Just very boring figures with almost no articulation, can't pose them or nothing.

│ Just got a Jet second hand for $35, but also came w the master emerald accessory from chaos. So I paid a bit more than retail, but it saves me the chance of just not being able to find him. I’ve found 0 Espio during this new wave so it’s nice to have a guarantee I don’t have to stress myself hunting for Jet. Just need fat penguin and tails

│ Can't believe we have pecky but not gamma or tikal... Absolutely crazy
└─
  ┌─ u/CarLeeForever7 | 1 points | 2025-07-14 00:24:18
  │ Definitely! It’s weird because giant Pecky only appears at the end of a stage finish of a certain Sonic Superstars game iirc.

│ We're definitely getting a Collectors Editions, along with a Movie Sonic skin.
│ 
│ The minute the Collectors Edition/Deluxe is up to buy in Amazon, I'm definitely placing my order.

│ This is a hot take but I’m not really a fan of how this figure looks I hope they make more different ones in the upcoming weeks

│ Steel book Edition with map
│ 
│ And a pricier Collectors edition box with a ‘30th Anniversary’ statue figure
│ 
│ Preorder “headstart” bonus is experience points and tokens

│ Most of the last games had some kind of deluxe or special edition. Forces, mania, colors ultimate, and origins. I don't see why not frontiers.

│ Hope so, unless it gets "limited exclusive" editions that become obscenely expensive, but I don't think it will have anything more then just extra customized minor thing in game, of that.

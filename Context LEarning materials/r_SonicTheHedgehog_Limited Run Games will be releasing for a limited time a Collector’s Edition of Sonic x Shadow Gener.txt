│ Lots of cool stuff, but $250 pre-tax and shipping is a steep asking price.  Honestly I only really want the game, statue, and the Dreamcast jewel case.

│ Limited Run is bleh, but at least they're not handling the game's entire physical print and they're just doing the collector's edition. This makes more sense to do through a limited-print company since it's such a niche product anyway.
│ 
│ Looks like a really cool CE - even better than the Japanese and Asian-region one in my opinion - but it's probably too expensive for me to consider buying (edit: it's $250, *yeesh*).
│ 
│ Also, is that a US-region PS4 physical copy I see? Have my prayers been answered?

  │ To be fair, they always state that their orders take longer. And they create orders based on pre orders, not having a limited amount get scooped up by bots. Sure it sucks to wait, but I'd rather that than deal with iam8bit or something.

│ this is so painfully tempting *but* I also ordered the s-fire sonic and shadow figure so I think it’s best if I just go with a standard copy of the game 😭 I’m in Canada so dropping $250 USD so soon after the s-fire figure isn’t the best idea lol

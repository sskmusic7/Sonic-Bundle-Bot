│ Prime has its charm and cool design but if the price isn’t a draw back for ya and you just want the bets shadow figure then the collectors is the best

│ This might be a hot take, but I like Prime Shadow more. For some reason the proportions on Collector Shadow look odd to me. Like his limbs are too long.

  │ They're also very skinny which doesn't look right set next to the collectors Sonic.

│ Probably the collector figure, but I'd go with the movie figure over both, since the collector figure is really expensive

│ If the Prime figure didn't have that "Prime look", it'd be damn near the perfect Shadow

│ I like both of them, wish Collectors Shadow had the same quality as the other collectors figures tho and such but other than that I like both of them

│ Collector's Shadow is the most accurate Shadow figure we've gotten to date.

│ I like the sonic prime shadow figure, but it’s got that weird orange tan to its reds colors. Looks like it lost its colors throughout the years

│ I have prime shadow and I absolutely love it. He feels very very sturdy (so do most the prime figures that is), he’s super easy to pose, and he looks amazing.

│ Prime Shadow is missing a lot of what makes Collectors Shadow cool, the accessories, the base, the scale, but it just looks like it's better quality. Yea the Collector figure looks rad in box but the base is the wring color, some boxes are missing the wing connectors, he's apparently hard to stand, and the body proportions just look off. I'd buy both if they were in front of me, but bang for buck I just think Prime takes it

│ My only complaint with the Prime figures is the fur texture on them. It just looks like weird veins on ther quills.

│ I would personally probably pick the Sonic prime figure for Shadow mostly because it's not a giant figure that I'm sure might be prone to loose joint syndrome over time with any kind of figure like that. I've never had any large scale Sonic figure that didn't become a floppy mess even though it just stood there on a shelf. 
│ 
│ I do like the looks of the collector figure a lot more but I wish it came with different expressions like Sonic and tails did. But 'tis the fate of Shadow the hedgehog's figures where he comes with bare minimum. Yes the display base is cool and the wings are a nice accessory but man would I like to have at least different expressions for that price..
│ 
│ That being said right now the only shadow figure in my collection is the one from Sonic 3 the movie and honestly I like that one a lot. I wish that level of articulation on that figure was available on a smaller game style version of him but as long as I have a shadow figure somewhere in my collection I'm perfectly fine.

│ Neither, Shadow Prime has an expressionless stare and Collectors shadow is too skinny for his head

│ Ok so weighing in as a fellow non owner, I hadn't even noticed any of the color issues other people pointed out so if that doesn't bother you, and you're not in it for the accessories, go with the prime figure. I want the collectors version just for appearance accuracy but I know in my heart it's just gonna come out, have the accessories swapped around once or twice, and then the accessories are gonna go in a bag in a closet except maybe the wings every once in a blue moon, but the figure itself is gonna see a lot of posing and play. In the long term, I think the Prime figure is more built for the long term pose and play, so if you're a displayer and you don't care about the accessories, I personally think the joints are thick enough that, as someone else already pointed out, they won't loosen up like the collectors threatens to just by appearances. 
│ 
│ Tl;dr Prime looks slightly worse accuracy wise but better build wise, get it if you don't care about accessories

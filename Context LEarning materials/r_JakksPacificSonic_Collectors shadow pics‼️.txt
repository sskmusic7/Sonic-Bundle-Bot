    │ I was right about to ask. I got knuckles, and he's barely standing up straight because of his loose ankles. It kinda disappointed me, but got him for $16 so I cant be too mad lol

      │ he stands fine just struggles to hold poses that have him having his legs up or not straight, also the head is kinda loose too but honestly it’s not too bad

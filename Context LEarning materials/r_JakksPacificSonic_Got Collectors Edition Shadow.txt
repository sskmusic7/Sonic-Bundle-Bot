Really love this guy but I wish I had the Collectors Edition Sonic to go with him. He's pretty tedious to pose with his wings on, but other than that he's awesome. And about preorders it seems I was right, Walmart has been cancelling these preorders of him whereas people like me who order after preorder date received them.

  │ Mine shipped quickly as well and I ordered this just yesterday. Also I was so excited to receive this in the mail that I didn't even notice that the package came with no bubble wrap or anything to protect my Collector Shadow 💀, but the box isn't dented in any way gladly

    │ Mine had no protection either 😭 the box for the forms 3 pack was beat up but I don’t care at all, I’m gonna toss it anyway. I’d be way more upset if the shadow box was ruined but thankfully it was just fine as well

      │ That's crazy, they need to start protecting our packages better, and same id be upset if my shadow box was damaged too cuz the visuals look really good

│ I ordered one, I have a feeling it will be hard to get as time goes on.

  │ That was my immediate thought, as soon as I saw it available on Walmart I jumped on it and bought it. And he's unfortunately already being scalped for $100-$110 online

│ He looks awesome I just can’t justify his price tag! It’s about the same quality of the 4 and 5 inch shadows. I get his wings are massive and he comes with a base to stand on and is a little bit taller overall but to add $40 additional dollars to its price I feel is a little bit to much if this was $30-$35 I’d pick it up for sure but $50 is almost criminal!

  │ Honestly I have to admit you're right, I was initially thrilled to have a new collectors shadow figure but the price tag is much. I like it but the accessories are lacking and the stand it comes with is pretty bad and the wings are too heavy.

    ┌─ u/yohoewutzup | 2 points | 2025-01-14 22:24:19
    │ He looks awesome regardless! He will probably be sought after in the future so I’m sure it’ll pay off in the long run having it in your collection.

      │ True, and I'm just glad to have it. So many people have already scalped the crap out of this figure it's crazy, I don't plan on letting go of this figure ever. Although if I could get another Shadow I'd try to trade it for anyone that has the Collectors Sonic

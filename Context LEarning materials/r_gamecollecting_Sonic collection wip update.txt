│ Nice! Really just 2 big ones left IIRC, Sonic R and Jam? Edit: also you HAVE to grab the N Gage Sonic just for shits and giggles lol

      │ That’s what I’m going for atm (the Sonic adventure 2 pack is a fever dream and will probably never happen tho tbh lol)

        │ Nice! I own some of these, but nowhere near on your level, you may have dodged a bullet not going for every SMS release, they’re getting ridiculous to find haha! I noticed Tails Adventure and Tails Sky Patrol were down recently as opposed to when I had last checked forever ago, so I grabbed Tail Adventure last week, I swore I remembered them being over 100+ each

          │ OH thank you for reminding me to add that to the list! I totally blanked on Tails’ adventure! Also yeah the master system ones are ABYSMAL price wise, would love to have em but not for the asking prices

            │ Not a problem! Haha I’m a pretty big Sonic fan myself so it’s always a pleasure to refresh a fellow fan’s memory on the huge game library! Are you going for Knuckles Chaotix? I found a random copy at a Half Price Books a couple years back super fairly priced, you find the most unexpected stuff when you aren’t looking at random places

│ Sonic Shuffle is a weird game that I loved. Feels like the kind of game your dream would make up rather than something that actually released

  ┌─ u/Ahri_Foxxi | 2 points | 2024-08-11 16:12:14
  │ Agreed, it’s like a bizarre take on the Mario Party formula that doesn’t end up feeling like “Sonic Party” somehow. Very fun 😊

    ┌─ u/breath_ofthemild | 2 points | 2024-08-11 16:17:28
    │ Like they wanted to make a Mario Party but tried to change every aspect, for better or worse. Even down to the movement system, choosing a weird card system instead of the tried and true dice system of any other board game

│ damn, nice stuff. Sadly most of what you need to have a full collection are the pricey titles (Sonic CD, Sonic R, Knuckles Chaotix, etc), but this is still impressive to say the least.

  │ Omg that’s a giant pickup that adventure double pack is a fever dream for me. Curious how much you ended up spending on that?

    ┌─ u/killswitchzero7 | 2 points | 2024-08-12 03:01:03
    │ They wanted 2200 but accepted 1200 which was honestly so surprising. There were listings for it already close to that price opened. So glad I could get it sealed.

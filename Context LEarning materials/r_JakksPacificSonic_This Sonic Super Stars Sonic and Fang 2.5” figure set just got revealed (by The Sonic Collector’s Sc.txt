  │ As cool as they are, it looks kinda jarring. It'll probably look better when i get it physically maybe

  │ Well, the thing is, merchandise takes time to plan, and if we're getting a lot of superstars merch, this means like they start planning for the merch of that game only last year and now, we're just seeing the fruits of their labor this year. Why we haven't got any frontier stuff is beyond me, but That's what jakks planned

  │ You've got a good point. As much as I'd like to see other classic games and characters get rep, i can see why they're trying to play it safe with the classic  releases focusing on mostly mania, superstars, and a smidge of the genesis trilogy. I understand it, but it still bums me out. I'd love to see a doomsday zone set or even a sonic 3 death egg robot set (even tho i can see why they wouldn't)

│ It's a good time to be a life-long Fang fan. I never thought we'd get a figure of him during the Jazwares era and now we get him AND the Marvelous Queen. So good.

  ┌─ u/HippieWizard | 1 points | 2025-06-22 14:29:33
  │ here's a tip for next time, they will NEVER include a gun of any kind in this kids line. especially Fangs which just looks like a real gun. not worth the blow back from 1 million moms just to make 13 specific fans happy.

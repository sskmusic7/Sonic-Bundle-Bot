  ┌─ u/thatonecoolnerd | 3 points | 2022-02-05 03:50:08
  │ Well the last “Ultimate Collector’s Edition” figure (Classic Sonic) was 6”. So I’m making a pretty confident guess this will also be 6”

│ I want to be impressed but Sonics are usually too top heavy to get any dynamic posing in.
│ 
│ My favorite and best Sonic is my Nendoroid. A nice blend of eras and he won't fall over.

  │ I didn’t even think of that! I was so hyped to see a more complete Sonic. 
  │ 
  │ They are very top heavy and I don’t know why they don’t hollow the head out or something. Hopefully this one figured it out because I would love a solid sonic in my collection and not one who can’t stand. 
  │ 
  │ Also, I would love it if somebody made Sonic Adventure 1&amp;2 style figure with the Soap sneakers. Hopefully in the future

┌─ u/Goodly88 | 3 points | 2024-07-20 09:52:39
│ Was River's the more expensive one for you as well? Out of my collection her's was more than even the 14's. Curious how 15th's will be like. Also thinking about getting that chrome platted 12th Doctor's Sonic since it has the same colors as 14ths.
└─
  ┌─ u/Leelinus1975 | 1 points | 2024-07-20 17:19:21
  │ Aw yes!  That one and the Master’s laser were the most expensive by far. And I got shafted because it was the version that’s only blue and the neural link doesn’t light up. 
  │ 
  │ People are selling SDCC pre-orders for 15’s makeup compact 😋on eBay for $150, but I put a hurting on my bank account after buying this stuff + most of the Funk POP’s I was missing.
  └─
    ┌─ u/Goodly88 | 1 points | 2024-07-20 17:23:58
    │ I waited until around Xmas last year for 14ths, turned out it was a knockoff. However, it had every light and worked just fine, may need fresher bats but works the same. Since it was about the same was when it came out for SDCC, I can't complain. The 12th Doctor's chrome will be about the same. 
    │ 
    │ My build-a-sonic was for a steal on ebay, however the core was swollen, but I managed to clean/fix it and works just fine. Even River's needed a good cleaning before batteries. Considering most I brought were still NiB.
    └─
      ┌─ u/Leelinus1975 | 2 points | 2024-07-20 18:11:57
      │ You know, I’m still not sure if I have the knockoff. Mine doesn’t have a lot of the knockoff’s tells, but does have one or two. I don’t care though. I watched a comparison video and the guy was shocked because he said he truly believed the knockoff was better. 🤷🏻‍♂️
      │ 
      │ My River sonic had a ton of corrosion in the battery case, but a little vinegar wipe down did the trick. 
      │ 
      │ I’m really ticked about the build your own sonic kit. Why couldn’t they charge a bit more and include two more cores?  I’m not going to display sonics that don’t work, so it seems like such a waste.

So I saw someone say there are two different versions of the figure. One which is just regular plastic  then the other is like a a rubbery matte plastic finish. Is the right? Lol

┌─ u/jjb265 | 4 points | 2024-05-19 14:02:19
│ It’s not rubbery but yes there are 2 different finishes the figure can have, I think it’s more down to quality control or different factory’s than variants though.
│ 
│ I’ve had both but only kept the glossy one, the glossy one is like most other jakks figures, and the matte figure I had felt almost like it wasn’t completely sanded or something, and the lines on the head looked really bad like it had weird lighter color patches, just seems like the quality control wasn’t as good, and that’s kind of unfortunate because I actually really like the way it looked other than the deflects, the wisp had a pretty decent paint spot missing on the front as well so I didn’t end up keeping that one
│ 
│ Overall I’d get the glossy version if you can

I was not happy with how fat modern sonic’s arms were normally so I decided to swap them with an extra classic Sonic that I got for cheap. It may not look like a big difference but to me it’s a lot more accurate. Unfortunately only classic sonic’s hands will fit but i can find a way to fit all of the modern hands eventually

  ┌─ u/freakierbug | 2 points | 2024-07-19 08:09:51
  │ Thank you! All I did was remove the hidden screw behind both sonic’s belly’s that holds the torso together and then just had to swap the arms and put back together. I believe there was a small amount of modification to allow the arm to fit flush in the socket but nothing crazy.

        │ I remember one year I dressed up as Sonic for Halloween even though I had played none of the games at the time lol. I was probably 10. I enjoyed Sonic X Shadow Generations a lot. I tried Mania too but it’s not really my cup of tea. I’ve played all the other older games too of course and love them. I’m working through Rush right now and it’s a blast. I’m gonna try Adventure next and I can’t wait. I heard it’s one of the best.

          │ The Rush games are SO good. Growing up Sonic Adventure 2 was always my favorite and to this day it’s my favorite game ever made. My second favorite is CD, which is definitely not for everyone but it’s so good. I’m glad you liked Sonic X Shadow, too! It was great, and a great direction for the series moving forward. Hopefully you continue to enjoy what you’re playing!! If you’re working on the DS entries you have to try Sonic Colors for DS after Rush Adventure. It’s basically the 3rd Rush game and it’s so much fun, I just replayed it recently!

              │ I really enjoy exploring in CD and how the gameplay can effect the environments. In the basic classic sonic design philosophy it doesn’t totally work but exploring and looking for the generators is really fun. I am also a victim of being swooned by the amazing aesthetics and soundtrack. I just enjoy going back to the game and 100% it in an afternoon and moving on. It’s so much fun! Sonic Rush does have so much incredible music too. It’s been a *looong* time since I’ve played it, I’m currently working through my DS library as a matter of fact so I’ll try and get to it soon! When you play the Adventure games, enjoy them for what they are and try not to focus on their shortcomings like many others do. In my opinion, they’re the best Sonic has ever been in terms of gameplay up until Shadow Generations recently. So fun, and nails the classic Sonic mentality of replayability being key. There’s also some games such as Shadow the Hedgehog that I cannot in my right mind call good, but I had so much fun last year when I finally played through the entire game. This series is something special, I’m glad you’re playing these games!

                │ The aesthetics and music is why I love Mario so much so I’m sure the more I play Sonic the more hooked I’ll get lol. I couldn’t imagine 100% the Sonic games I’ve played myself lol. I’m not gonna lie some of them were really difficult. But that’s part of the fun. From what I’ve seen, Adventure seems to really handle the characters well and has a lot of different character interactions which is something I think Mario lacks. I’ve heard mixed things about Shadow the Hedgehog lol. I’ll get to it when I get to it 🤷‍♂️

                  │ I only like to 100% the classic games. The modern games have way too much stuff that’s too challenging for me to 100%. I don’t really find many sonic games hard if I’m honest, but some of those challenges required to beat it are a serious pain. There are some games like Heroes and 06 that are hard because of infuriating design and not because of well crafted challenge, though. Sonic is pretty inconsistent but one thing across the series that hits hard is the music, and some games just have amazing aesthetics. The characters really are at their best in the Adventure games, they’re handled so well. As a fellow fan of both Mario and Sonic, Sonic definitely offers MUCH more in terms of character interaction and depth. And I’m curious what you’ll think of Shadow one day. It’s a mixed bag for sure!

Really love this guy but I wish I had the Collectors Edition Sonic to go with him. He's pretty tedious to pose with his wings on, but other than that he's awesome. And about preorders it seems I was right, Walmart has been cancelling these preorders of him whereas people like me who order after preorder date received them.

│ He looks awesome I just can’t justify his price tag! It’s about the same quality of the 4 and 5 inch shadows. I get his wings are massive and he comes with a base to stand on and is a little bit taller overall but to add $40 additional dollars to its price I feel is a little bit to much if this was $30-$35 I’d pick it up for sure but $50 is almost criminal!

Hey Everyone! 

I wanted to introduce myself. My name is Omar, I'm the owner of the store [IamRetro.com](http://IamRetro.com)

As some of you may know, we are a bit new to providing the Jakks Pacific line of figures in our store. I've seen our store name being mentioned here on Reddit and I thought it would be a great opportunity for me to post here and reach out to the Sonic community. We have had an account with Jakks for about a year coming up and the selection of items continues to grow. 

So I thought posting here would be a good way to have an open dialogue and connect with collectors. If you have any questions for me, or about how our business works, or any products you think we should carry, please let me know.

│ Really awesome finally having good communication from a real jakks pacific seller. 
│ 
│ 
│ Do you guys plan on stocking every NEW Jakks Sonic and SEGA wave going forward (2.5, 4, 5 and 6 inch)? 
│ 
│ 
│ It's so hard to keep track of which new waves go to which stores both physically and online (mostly due to how Jakks ships each wave), but if the majority of them were all in one place that would change everything!

  ┌─ u/iamretro1 | 16 points | 2025-04-25 15:44:58
  │ That's so refreshing to hear! 
  │ 
  │ The answer is YES!! We are planning on continuing to offer every single wave we can each in 2.5" + 5" and 6" basically any variation that they start to release for the Sonic releases. We do have incoming stock of Shadow collectors edition and Sonic Prime Wave 5 incoming. It's just taken a lot of capital investment to bring in the right amount of stock to keep our inventory active. As well as keeping up with a lot of the other lines of figures Jakks produces like Simpsons and Mario. But we should be getting to all cylinders firing shortly. 
  │ 
  │ I agree it is tough to keep track of everything which is why we see the opportunity to try and provide some reassurance in the collector space on finding these items consistently in one place.

    │ Can't wait to see more and thanks again for reaching out to the community!
    │ 
    │ 
    │ One more note I'll leave you with (because you're gonna hear it from everyone at some point):
    │ 
    │ 
    │ - if possible, try and find a way to increase stock of other characters in each Sonic wave. Sonic himself gets a lot per shipment while the other characters like Knuckles, Eggman and Neo Metal Sonic only get ONE figure per shipment (all scales/sizes). This is the main issue consumers have with most jakks products (especially with Sonic and SEGA).
    │ - I know that might be difficult to work out, but I just thought I would point it out in detail now since it's going to be a big request you will hear non stop from the community over time.

      │ Haha! Yes, you are absolutely spot on with this one. Unfortunately when we purchase from Jakks Pacific we get them in case packs and the case packs are already determined in advance which characters we will get more of than others. 
      │ 
      │ We will do our best but that's also why we are seeing that the more rare figures tend to sell out faster than the commons. There have been multiple suggestions on how to keep the more rare or limited figures in stock but yes we are already dealing with that on the Simpsons line of figures and also with Sonic. Thank you for your feedback and definitely feel free to reach out in this thread anytime you'd like to communicate with me on things you may spot that could be a huge help to the community. I know we won't be able to please everyone in all of this but we are putting our best foot forward to be a consistent and reasonable source for the collectors alike in the Jakks Pacific world. 
      │ 
      │ Appreciate you!

        │ Figured as much. Personally, I was more just curious on what is and isn't possible because every figure that isn't Sonic is considered rare. Lol.
        │ 
        │ 
        │ (now everyone knows 😅)
        │ 
        │ 
        │ Well, I would say just continue to promote your new inventory and keep those available for as long as humanly possible. That would give everyone enough time and a chance to make iamretro a more recognized distributor of Jakks pacific products. You'd be surprised how many new fans we get in this community literally every day.

      ┌─ u/iamretro1 | 7 points | 2025-04-25 15:47:10
      │ Yes! Agreed, and we have weekly meetings with Jakks to stay in the loop as a lot of the time things are moving so fast. Their products are in such high demand that when inventory does become available it sometimes evaporates with a quickness but hopefully we can be another avenue for collectors to check in with us if you have no luck finding these in the wild (Target, Walmart, etc.)

  │ We also offer free shipping worldwide. Here is a breakdown of our shipping thresholds. 
  │ 
  │ 
  │ 
  │ Get Free Shipping within the USA when you spend $29
  │ 
  │ Free Shipping to Canada when you spend $149
  │ 
  │ Free Shipping to Worldwide when you spend $299
  │ 
  │ This is the total it has to match after any discounts or coupon codes applied on the above pricing thresholds. But if you just need a single figure definitely rates do apply and we always do our best to try and provide multiple ways to offer good value to customers with shipping rates.

  ┌─ u/iamretro1 | 3 points | 2025-04-25 16:28:34
  │ Thank you and Noted! 
  │ 
  │ Do collectors like to purchase the new waves as a complete set or do you guys tend to shop for the characters individually?
  └─
    ┌─ u/Finn493 | 2 points | 2025-04-25 16:42:50
    │ We tend to chase after the new and unique figures from each wave no matter what the size is (but new fans might still want the older figures they previously missed out on).
    │ 
    │ 
    │ Bundling each NEW figure from each wave and excluding the re-releases could be a cool idea (and just sell the re-release by itself).
    │ 
    │ 
    │ But overall, Single releases of each figure will always be the most popular idea.
    └─
      ┌─ u/iamretro1 | 2 points | 2025-04-25 17:46:48
      │ Good to know! I think we'll offer bundled sets of the new waves and also individual figures so collectors can grab what they need. Thanks for the feedback!
      └─
    ┌─ u/qwertyui43210 | 2 points | 2025-04-25 18:34:45

      │ Just a heads up we have Wave 22 of the 2.5" Sonic figures coming in within the next week or so. We were initially thinking of putting together a set to sell but after the feedback you provided I think you're right and we will be offering the figures individually.

└─
  ┌─ u/iamretro1 | 3 points | 2025-04-25 18:03:54
  │ That's awesome to hear! I'm so happy we could provide an opportunity for the collectors to get the figure at a reasonable price. It's been really tough to keep up with the demand of this figure. As we get confirmed orders from Jakks they are instantly selling out which is why we had a back order placed on the item in our shop. But we only backorder items we have 100% confirmation we are receiving inventory and dedicated to our store. 
  │ 
  │ Really appreciate the message and will be updating everyone on new incoming items that should be landing in the shop.

Dealing in toys since 2013.

  │ 
  │ Also as everyone else said I would definitely like to see y'all restock more on other characters it's hard for a lot of us in smaller towns trying to search for figures just seeing only sonic himself 😭 Neo metal/jet/silver will definitely be your biggest request realistically unlike those people asking for super shadow

  │ Our website is filled with verified buyers who leave reviews for us. They also post pictures of their collections which you can find on our home page if you scroll down. Do a quick google search "iamretro" you'll see we have been around for a while. But we are fairly new to the Jakks Pacific space. If you're on the fence about doing business with us I understand, but you can also check us out on instagram where we have over 27k followers.

  ┌─ u/iamretro1 | 2 points | 2025-04-26 15:00:31
  │ Hey there, thanks for commenting. Yes we will be restocking but we also need confirmation that Jakks will be guaranteeing us units. This will go into a "backorder" which just means that the moment we get the confirmation from Jakks, we will make those incoming units available for purchase. All we will be waiting for is Jakks warehouse to process a shipment to IamRetro warehouse and once our crew checks in and receives the inventory, then orders can begin to get processed. This backorder is a temporary wait usually around 10-14 days. 
  │ 
  │ I'm just clarifying in case there is any confusion. We should be getting a confirmation on a restock shortly but until then we don't want to solicit anything we cannot guarantee. Make sure to sign up for the "Notify Me" request on the listing so you an email letting you know when they go back into a positive inventory.

Often times there is absolutely no way we can match big box stores pricing but it just depends on the overall availability and access we have to the product and also margin. We just don't have the same purchasing power as a Target or Walmart but we do try our best. Really appreciate your comment!

I used a lighter blue paint for the whole body, a dark blue for the shadows, and a really light blue for the highlights. I repainted his eyes with white and redid one eye to face slightly sideways and the other one winking. Then I just used either slightly lighter or darker paints for the rest of the shadows :) I just used generic Walmart and Hobby Lobby acrylic paint haha

│ Really good collection! I'm curious tho where is that Sonic statue from in the last picture? Also could you post an image of Jazwares Tails super poser and jakks Tails side by side, I'd like to see how they scale

  │ The Sonic statue is a bootleg of the 20 anniversary joypolis statute, right now I can’t do a comparison between the superposer tails and the collector edition tails since there in my weekend house, but I will post a comparison between the two of them on Sunday, because that’s the day I go to my other house

Hi, I recently bought a second Collector's Sonic from IAmRetro.com, and I noticed that my new one's plastic is much more "rubber-like" than the original release. Just thought it'd be a cool thing to point out, since I was wondering what they meant by "premium finish" on the original. Super cool that these are getting easier to buy again, always thought it was weird that his release was so limited.

I previously collected Jakks Mario figures, but I've made the switch and I have some questions!

1) What all is there to collect? I think I've seen some 2.5" and 4", is there anything else?

2) How's the variety among figures? I ask because the Jakks Mario figures didn't have much variety in 4" and were not much better in 2.5" (in recent years at least)

3) Where's the best place to buy these figures in bulk? And related question, what are the rare figures to keep an eye our for when shopping?

4) Are there any fan made checklists to make sure I'm buying all of the figures?

Lastly, what's your favorite figure and why? I'd love to learn more about how yall engage with the hobby.

Thanks!

│ Depends on what you want, but let's start with "Everything" and work around that.
│ 
│ The 2.5 is the easiest to get into, and can be easily found in Walmart check-out lanes. Decent variety, but some of the old figures like Super Shadow and Charmy are a ***** to get. 
│ 
│ The main 4 inch line is great. Just about every hero, modern and classic is "available"....and by that I mean they all have a toy. Finding anyone other than Sonic is a pain however.
│ 
│ Walm-mart and Target are the 2 big retailers that carry the figs, however their stocking isn't the greatest. 
│ 
│ Bulk buying? Ebay or a donation site/flea market. 
│ 
│ The other things are the Sonic Prime and movie figures, both 5 inch. 
│ 
│ And then the 6 inch collector figures.
│ 
│ Shadow can be found at Gamestop, but he's got the most problems out of them all. Primarily, his accessories (or lack there of)
│ 
│ The most important rule about these is
│ 
│ They are children's toys. Don't tear your hair out over it.

│ I personally collect Classic Sonic-era figures, and they are some of my favorite figures in recent memory. I've seen many collectors who prefer 2.5" for Classic and 4" for Modern as they feel they scale better to each other.
│ 
│ Either way for the Classic characters I recommend to stick to 2.5" for all of them, except for Dr. Eggman and Mecha Sonic. If you get the Egg Mobile it will come with a 2.5" Dr. Eggman (sadly the 4" version doesn't fit). 
│ 
│ As for Egg Robo, you could get both, depending on if you want the larger S&amp;K scale or the smaller Sonic R scale, which also would fit in the Egg Mobile.

│ 1. There's also movie 5 inch figures and 6 inch collectors ones.
│ 2. Pretty good in variety for both 4 inch and 2.5 inch, but they rerelease sonic a lot.
│ 3. In the UK, smyths for 4 inch, entertainer for 2.5 inch, not sure abt anywhere else
│ 4. Yes, there's quite a lot of them
│ 5. I love my 2.5 inch modern knuckles, but I'm a bit biased because it was my first one

  │ Unless it is a local deal where they are meeting them in person they definitely should not go for it. The value there is way too good to be true. $200 in market value of figures for $25? No way.

┌─ u/ashegreyy | 1 points | 2025-02-05 15:45:46
│ Check description, Facebook marketplace sellers will have these listed separate prices but put these all under one so they dont have to make multiple listings, so just double check that it's all of them or just each for $25

│ Be careful if they are shipping it to you then it is most likely a scam. If you are meeting them locally then they can't scam you. If it is a scam they will likely try to get you to pay through cash app or zelle, and will not accept PayPal unless you do friends and family. To me it looks like this is probably a scam unless it is someone locally who does not know what they are worth.
│ 
│ Market value of everything here is around 200 dollars so I highly doubt this is real.
└─
  ┌─ u/MiK3R_YT | 1 points | 2025-02-05 23:06:29
  │ It is local i messaged them and they responded confirming its the whole lot for $25, but then they just stopped responding after i tried to set up a meet up place.
  └─
    ┌─ u/damon_6363 | 1 points | 2025-02-05 23:08:40
    │ Sounds shady. Did you confirm with them that they are local to you? Sometimes scammers will list locally and say they moved or some sort of excuse for them to need to ship it. If it is legit tho that's crazy.
    └─
      ┌─ u/MiK3R_YT | 1 points | 2025-02-05 23:10:33

POST CONTENT:
----------------------------------------
The 6" Collector Sonic figure arrived and...it's very weird. Joints aren't designed well and the limbs are too thick but that was obvious already. But this ultra fine, velvety matte finish sprayed onto all the blue parts is so bizarre. The spots where it's gotten scuffed can't be fixed, and there was a lot of the sprayed gunk built up around the knee and hip joints I had to scrape off too. I wish they'd just used regular blue plastic even if it had a slight sheen to it. Did the original release of this figure have the same strange finish to the blue parts? 

Both the 6" Sonic and Shadow are not good figures for different reasons, but it's still nice to have a 6" figure of them anyway. 
  
Anyways, if you want yours without paying scalper prices you can order from 'I Am Retro' and use the link for an extra $10 off along with the free shipping to bring the total down to about $55 &gt; [https://loox.io/z/sHBzWJdBp](https://loox.io/z/sHBzWJdBp)

┌─ u/6eis7iete | 2 points | 2025-03-22 03:11:30
│ OP, since you were curious: the original production run of this figure actually does use that bare shiny blue plastic finish. That is the first production run of the figure and the box says "collector edition", (no 's'). Most reviews on YouTube showcase this version. The figure got a second production run, "collectors edition", with this same finish, which the Modern Tails figure also features. This re-issue is based off that second production run.
└─
  ┌─ u/ToyNerdProd | 1 points | 2025-03-22 04:21:08

    ┌─ u/6eis7iete | 2 points | 2025-03-22 05:45:25
    │ Personally, I like it because they display better imo. Though, I brought up Tails specifically because he's the only other modern collector figure currently. I believe the classic ones have the same finish as well. The inconsistencies are odd, but the Sonic and Shadow don't really display well anyway since they look so different, finish aside.

    │ Use different emotions, fists, accessories that aren't useless and can be held (without rubbing the paint off cough cough cream and her icecream)

POST CONTENT:
----------------------------------------
Hello! I’m just trying to see if anyone would be willing to trade their 5 inch black knight figures for these collectors figures or the 3 inch Sonic with Caliburn. I’m also looking to trade for 2011 5 inch Modern Sonic, the Sonic colors 5 inch figure with wisps, and I’m open to other offers

The Sonic is pretty rare now in aftermarket so I’m wondering if anyone would want to trade for them. They’re both unopened figures that are complete and brand new in the box

I’m hoping I don’t get clowned on for this offer, I’m just trying to expand my collection and such since I wasn’t old enough to buy toys myself when these were still around

I also have a Shadow I can add depending on the character

Thank you for your time, I’m hoping we can do some trades and I’m hoping I can make some great deals!

┌─ u/StellarStardrop | 2 points | 2025-02-07 03:59:35
│ Prime Shadow is missing a lot of what makes Collectors Shadow cool, the accessories, the base, the scale, but it just looks like it's better quality. Yea the Collector figure looks rad in box but the base is the wring color, some boxes are missing the wing connectors, he's apparently hard to stand, and the body proportions just look off. I'd buy both if they were in front of me, but bang for buck I just think Prime takes it

│ I would personally probably pick the Sonic prime figure for Shadow mostly because it's not a giant figure that I'm sure might be prone to loose joint syndrome over time with any kind of figure like that. I've never had any large scale Sonic figure that didn't become a floppy mess even though it just stood there on a shelf. 
│ 
│ I do like the looks of the collector figure a lot more but I wish it came with different expressions like Sonic and tails did. But 'tis the fate of Shadow the hedgehog's figures where he comes with bare minimum. Yes the display base is cool and the wings are a nice accessory but man would I like to have at least different expressions for that price..
│ 
│ That being said right now the only shadow figure in my collection is the one from Sonic 3 the movie and honestly I like that one a lot. I wish that level of articulation on that figure was available on a smaller game style version of him but as long as I have a shadow figure somewhere in my collection I'm perfectly fine.
└─

┌─ u/arepa_man | 1 points | 2025-02-07 20:42:51

└─

┌─ u/Rugbump | 1 points | 2025-02-20 07:25:42
│ Ok so weighing in as a fellow non owner, I hadn't even noticed any of the color issues other people pointed out so if that doesn't bother you, and you're not in it for the accessories, go with the prime figure. I want the collectors version just for appearance accuracy but I know in my heart it's just gonna come out, have the accessories swapped around once or twice, and then the accessories are gonna go in a bag in a closet except maybe the wings every once in a blue moon, but the figure itself is gonna see a lot of posing and play. In the long term, I think the Prime figure is more built for the long term pose and play, so if you're a displayer and you don't care about the accessories, I personally think the joints are thick enough that, as someone else already pointed out, they won't loosen up like the collectors threatens to just by appearances. 
│ 
│ Tl;dr Prime looks slightly worse accuracy wise but better build wise, get it if you don't care about accessories

POST CONTENT:
----------------------------------------
I’ve been looking for him for a long time now but it’s almost like he’s kinda being scrubbed from the internet. All the other collectors editions are widely available on most retailers but this guy is just kinda… gone? The only thing I really see is a Mercari posting asking for 150 dollars. (sadly I would pay it, if the seller would respond to any of my messages). Am I missing something? Was he part of a limited run? I’m hoping he gets restocked in the future cause it would suck to never see this guy again.

│ I would recommend you hold out for a bit longer. Seeing the new Ultimate Shadow figure, they will likely release a V2 of the Sonic mould with the same updated articulation.
└─
  ┌─ u/BREAKUPVILLE | 5 points | 2024-10-16 19:20:14
  │ Yeah, I was going to put that in my post as well but didn’t want to make it too long. The only problem I have with an updated version would be that the ultimate shadow has no swappable hands or faces, so if an updated version comes out at some point I hope they don’t completely remove them like they are with shadow. (I still plan on buying shadow as well tho lol)
  └─
    ┌─ u/AdPuzzleheaded9164 | 5 points | 2024-10-16 19:23:39
    │ In Shadows case, the reason he comes with no swappable accessories is down to the massive wings, and more complex stand he comes with. It's not likely Sonic would be given such a large accessory like that, though his amount of accessories would probably suffer a bit or a downsize, given more of the budget going to the figure itself. (Unless they manage to pull something similar to the Movie 3 figures or the Superposers, and articulate the fingers.)

┌─ u/MeeMtheMemer | 6 points | 2024-10-16 19:19:12
│ The shadow figure has very different articulation and it’s much better than this figure this figure is more like the prime figures while shadows like the movie figures. So they’ll probably make a v2 with updated articulation and maybe an updated stand to make it fit with the same style as the shadow
└─
  ┌─ u/BREAKUPVILLE | 3 points | 2024-10-16 19:23:57
  │ Yeah he has way more points of articulation but at the cost of having no swappable hands or faces which isn’t the worst thing but if that’s the direction they wanna move into with a V2 sonic it would be cool to see the old modern one come back
  └─
    ┌─ u/MeeMtheMemer | 1 points | 2024-10-16 19:24:55

│ Limited Run is bleh, but at least they're not handling the game's entire physical print and they're just doing the collector's edition. This makes more sense to do through a limited-print company since it's such a niche product anyway.
│ 
│ Looks like a really cool CE - even better than the Japanese and Asian-region one in my opinion - but it's probably too expensive for me to consider buying (edit: it's $250, *yeesh*).

Hi all, I preordered the Sonic X Shadow Collector’s edition back in September 2024 and the expected shipment date was July 2025. Now I was emailed that the shipping date has been pushed back to November. Did anyone else get this? Did anyone receive their collector’s edition? Please let me know.

│ The biggest mistake was sourcing LRG for this, main reason I passed on trying to get one, despite really wanting the statue and chao figures. first4figures probably would have been more expensive, but a better choice imo

│ Word of advice when ordering CEs or other stuff that aren't just games(or clothing, I think, but I never ordered clothes from them, so maybe?) post-pandemic.

│ Never expect the CEs on the day they're planned to arrive.

My collector’s edition finally arrived yesterday and was able to unbox it today after work! 🙌🏻 

This edition is really nice! I ordered this specifically for the Shadow figurine and the artbook. I thought the figurine would be a bit small but it is the right size for me and is a bit heavy. I haven’t checked the artbook since I have yet to play the game (still finishing up Radiant Tale lol).

Hope you guys enjoy the game! (Tell me how is it lol)

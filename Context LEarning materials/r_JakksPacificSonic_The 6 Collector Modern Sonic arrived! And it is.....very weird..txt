The 6" Collector Sonic figure arrived and...it's very weird. Joints aren't designed well and the limbs are too thick but that was obvious already. But this ultra fine, velvety matte finish sprayed onto all the blue parts is so bizarre. The spots where it's gotten scuffed can't be fixed, and there was a lot of the sprayed gunk built up around the knee and hip joints I had to scrape off too. I wish they'd just used regular blue plastic even if it had a slight sheen to it. Did the original release of this figure have the same strange finish to the blue parts? 

Both the 6" Sonic and Shadow are not good figures for different reasons, but it's still nice to have a 6" figure of them anyway. 
  
Anyways, if you want yours without paying scalper prices you can order from 'I Am Retro' and use the link for an extra $10 off along with the free shipping to bring the total down to about $55 &gt; [https://loox.io/z/sHBzWJdBp](https://loox.io/z/sHBzWJdBp)

│ He really doesn't scale well with Shadow at all

  │ Nope, both these figures look like they're from different lines but that's the best 6" of each we've got

    │ They look really good on their own. But it still does bother me that Shadow looks so frail compared to Sonic

      │ I'd say the opposite. That it's Sonic who is too thick since Shadow's proportions are more accurate

│ He’s got aura, but he’s so bad. I love him personally, but objectively he’s flawed in almost every way

  │ I agree. Finish, proportions, joints, weird lenticular base. All should have been better. But they did include a lot of cool extras with him unlike Shadow at least

│ I personally prefer Sonic than shadow while yes the Matt finish is awful in some copies, I like that he is bulkier than shadow because his joints are stronger and less fragile. Shadow feels really flimsy, cheap and his base is too small. Overall i feel that Sonic just has better quality the only thing that I would personally add in a V2 is just the ankle joints and the new hands that shadow has

    │  That’s sucks I hope you got a refund or a new one. Mine came with very loose upper arms. I managed to fix with some super glue, but I ran into a another problem, the wings after a month they began incline because there so heavy. Such a disappointing figure.

│ I like the thicker sonic, shadow would not be struggling to stand if he had a bit more with to his limbs. He’s so frail and I cannot even stand Shadow up on his own without the help of a bought display stand. Especially with the wings attached.

  ┌─ u/ToyNerdProd | 2 points | 2025-03-20 18:25:05
  │ The limb thickness doesn't affect how well he stands. That's the fault of the crappy and loose joints he has.

│ OP, since you were curious: the original production run of this figure actually does use that bare shiny blue plastic finish. That is the first production run of the figure and the box says "collector edition", (no 's'). Most reviews on YouTube showcase this version. The figure got a second production run, "collectors edition", with this same finish, which the Modern Tails figure also features. This re-issue is based off that second production run.

  │ Thanks! I had no idea the Tails also has this stupid finish sprayed onto it.... I don't like the sound of that at all. The way they did Shadow with regular plastic works just fine.

    ┌─ u/6eis7iete | 2 points | 2025-03-22 05:45:25
    │ Personally, I like it because they display better imo. Though, I brought up Tails specifically because he's the only other modern collector figure currently. I believe the classic ones have the same finish as well. The inconsistencies are odd, but the Sonic and Shadow don't really display well anyway since they look so different, finish aside.

│ Ahh, see, I prefer the matte finish! I have the version without it and I'm not a big fan, the matte looks more clean to me. But I definitely agree his limbs are too thick, he's difficult to pose.

  │ Mine has qc issues as the op too. Random other color smudges and weird hard parts like the plastic got cut wrong or something. Arms are difficult to move but I found taking the hands off and moving them helped better. Felt like it would break but it didn’t

│ I have the original 6" figure. He didn't have any fuzz or gunk on him but the 6" Tomy Classic Sonic did. I don't know why they opted to do that when plastic would have sufficed. To this day I've been battling to clean Tomy sonic and by the looks of it you might be battling to clean your modern sonic too

  │ Tbh if they did the movie figure styled articulation with those proportions and the height of 6", I think the figures would be a lot better

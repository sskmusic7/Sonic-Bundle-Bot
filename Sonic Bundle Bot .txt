Devised local Playwright strategy for Sonic collectible hunting.

Absolutely! Running Playwright locally will be much more efficient and won't hit any limits. Here's how you can set this up:

Now here's the setup guide and package.json to get you started:


Package.json for Sonic Bundle Hunter

Pondered clear instructions for local Playwright browsing solution.
0s


🚀 Quick Setup Instructions
1. Setup (Terminal/Command Prompt):
bash
# Create project folder
mkdir sonic-bundle-hunter
cd sonic-bundle-hunter

# Copy the files above into:
# - sonic_hunter.js (main script)
# - package.json (dependencies)

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install browser
npx playwright install chromium
2. Run the Hunt:
bash
npm run hunt
3. What It Does:
Searches eBay & Mercari for all items in your strategy
Filters items under $25 automatically
Downloads product images to sonic_results/images/
Analyzes bundle opportunities based on your two target bundles
Saves everything as JSON + CSV files with URLs, prices, seller info
4. Results Structure:
sonic_results/
├── sonic_collectibles_2025-08-03.json  # Complete data
├── sonic_collectibles_2025-08-03.csv   # Spreadsheet format
└── images/                              # Product photos
    ├── item_001.jpg
    └── item_002.jpg
5. Customize the Search:
Edit the STRATEGY object in the script to:

Add more search terms
Change max price per item
Add new bundle templates
Modify target profit margins
6. Optional: Facebook Marketplace
Facebook requires login, so I focused on eBay/Mercari first. If you want Facebook included, I can add that module too.

After you run this locally, just paste the JSON results back here and I'll help you:

Identify the best bundle opportunities
Create optimized listings with descriptions
Build a tracking spreadsheet for ROI monitoring
Plan your purchase sequence for maximum profit
Want me to modify anything in the script before you run it?

Engineered comprehensive Sonic collectible bundle hunter with Facebook support.
6s





Perfect! I've added comprehensive Facebook Marketplace support to your Sonic bundle hunter. Here's what's new:

🆕 Facebook Marketplace Features Added:
🔐 Multiple Login Options:
Environment Variables (most secure):
bash
export FB_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
export FB_PASSWORD="your-password"
Config File (edit config.js):
javascript
facebook: {
  email: "your-email@example.com", 
  password: "your-password"
}
Interactive Prompt (script asks when you run it)
🛡️ Security Handling:
2FA Support: Script pauses when 2FA appears, you complete it manually, then press Enter
Security Checks: Handles Facebook's anti-bot measures
Smart Delays: Extra time between Facebook searches to avoid rate limiting
🔍 Facebook Search Features:
Searches Facebook Marketplace with your exact search terms
Automatically applies price filters (under $25 by default)
Extracts item titles, prices, images, and direct links
Handles Facebook's dynamic page structure
📁 Updated File Structure:
sonic-bundle-hunter/
├── sonic_hunter.js     # Main script with Facebook support
├── config.js          # Centralized configuration  
├── package.json       # Dependencies
└── README.md          # Complete setup guide
🚀 Quick Start:
Create the files from the artifacts above
Install: npm install && npx playwright install chromium
Set Facebook credentials (use any of the 3 methods above)
Run: npm run hunt
📊 Expected Results:
The script will now search all three platforms and give you results like:

eBay: 15-20 items per search term
Mercari: 10-15 items per search term
Facebook: 15-20 items per search term
Total expected items: 120-165 Sonic collectibles under $25 across all platforms!

💡 Facebook-Specific Benefits:
Local deals: Facebook often has better local pricing
Less competition: Fewer resellers monitoring Facebook vs eBay
Bulk sellers: People clearing out collections
Negotiation: Direct messaging for bundle deals
After you run this locally, just paste the JSON results back here and I'll help you:

Identify the most profitable bundles
Create optimized listing descriptions
Build a tracking spreadsheet for ROI monitoring
Plan your purchase sequence for maximum profit


✅ Simple Setup:

Create a new folder: mkdir sonic-bundle-hunter && cd sonic-bundle-hunter
Copy only the final version of each of the 4 files above
Run: npm install && npx playwright install chromium
Run: npm run hunt

The correct script should have:

✅ Facebook Marketplace support
✅ Config file system
✅ All three platforms (eBay, Mercari, Facebook)
✅ Bundle analysis
✅ Image downloading

Want me to create a single, clean artifact with just the final script? That might be clearer than seeing all 21 update versions!

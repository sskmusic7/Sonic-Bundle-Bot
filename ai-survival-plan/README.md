# AI Survival Monetization Loop

This project implements a self-funding AI agent that generates income through various task platforms, content automation, and publishing. The agent operates autonomously while utilizing a human interface for verification and visual quality control.

## Project Structure

- **src/index.js**: Main entry point for the application, responsible for reading and processing the data from the JSON file and implementing the monetization plan.
- **src/data/ai_survival_plan.json**: Contains the JSON data outlining the AI survival monetization loop, including goals, phases, tasks, and API usage policies.
- **package.json**: Configuration file for npm, listing dependencies and scripts for the project.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd ai-survival-plan
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To run the application, execute the following command:
```
node src/index.js
```

This will initiate the monetization loop as defined in the `ai_survival_plan.json` file. Ensure that all necessary configurations and API keys are set up before running the application.
